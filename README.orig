Getopt-Nearly-Everything

I began writing this module after time and time again not having the
features I wanted in any other CPAN module, in a simple, flexible 
interface. Don't get me wrong - there are some *really* nice Getopt
modules out there, but nothing else has *everything* I want in one
tidy package, and nothing else has an interface that lets me be both
*neurotically explicit* *and* obscenely lazy with the same API.

This module currently has two names and one abbreviation, and I think 
they are all apropos of both the above description of it's existence 
and my state of mind when I found myself actually beginning to create it.

 GoNE
   Which is short for:
     Getopt::Nearly::Everything
       - OR -
     Getopt::Neurotically::Explicit

I intend this module to encompass just about every need one may have
wrt. options processing... and it will work as a drop-in replacement
for the venerable Getopt::Long.
